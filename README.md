# AntennaTracker
This is the new Antenna Tracker program for the tracking of High Altitude Balloons. This tracker uses information from an external GPS device to determine the ground station's location and compares to the location from the balloon via the IRIDIUM satelite network and optionally a LoRa device.
This project is in development and may see sporatic updates.
